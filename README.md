# Psychophysics_Analyses

Analysis of human behavioral data of visual stimulus of different spatial patterns and color.
I investigated how spatial pattern and color influence human detection. I collected the data using a 2-alternate forced choice experiment and extracted 
psychometric functions. I used detection thresholds as measure of visual detection performance.
The results from this study was presented in Fall Vision Meeting (2016).
